# Capstone Project List
Below is a list of the projects for the Spring 2026 semester. 

# Community Projects
## Pitt Street Medicine Team
### Pitt Street Medicine Street Go

**Objective**: The objective of this capstone project is to continue developing Street Med Go, a multimodal accessible website application for individuals served by Street Medicine at Pitt, including those at the Second Avenue Commons Clinic. 

The project's focus is to allow individuals to request/order necessities, including food, beverages, clothing, toiletries, basic medical supplies, and other supplies as needed, in addition to Street Medicine at Pitt’s weekly Wednesday evening “street rounds,” and make modifications as appropriate based on client feedback.

**Background**: Street Medicine at Pitt is a student-run interdisciplinary organization dedicated to providing healthcare and social support to the rough-sleeping and unhoused communities in Pittsburgh. The organization is affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, which recently established the Center for Street Medicine. Street Medicine at Pitt partners with the Second Avenue Commons Clinic, which provides shelter access, medical services, and engagement centers for adults experiencing homelessness in Pittsburgh.

## Borges Center
### Borges Site Migration and Enhancement

Jorge Luis Borges (Buenos Aires, Argentina 1899-Geneva, Switzerland1986) was the most important writer in Spanish in the twentieth century, considered one of the great world writers of the modern period. In 1995 Iván Almeida and Cristina Parodi founded the Borges Center at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. When they retired from Aarhus, they ceded the direction of the Center to Daniel Balderston, and it has been housed at the University of Iowa (2006-2008) and then at the University of Pittsburgh (2008-present). The Center is currently co-directed by Balderston and Alfredo Alonso Estenoz (Luther College). The website is consulted by students and scholars all over the world. It includes a detailed timeline of Borges's life and works, links to countless first versions of his work, a vast collection of criticism, a Finder's Guide or index to his writing, abundant information about his talks and interviews, and works of music and the visual arts that were inspired by him. The current website is www.borges.pitt.edu and is a Drupal site housed at the University of Pittsburgh. The recent decision by the university to move websites from Drupal to Open Scholar means that the site needs to be updated.

In fall 2025 two excellent SCI students, Jing Tong and Hiuyeung Kong, worked on revising the site so that it can be hosted on Open Scholar. They were able to move much of the site to a development page, (https://researchsites.pitt.edu/borgescenter)[https://researchsites.pitt.edu/borgescenter]. To finish the job we need two SCI students in spring 2026. The main tasks will be:

1. To try to match the appearance of the old side as closely as possible. The Open Scholar version uses sans serif fonts on the home page, but these should be serif fonts, and the font sizes and appearance should be unified within the whole site.

2. The students last semester did not have time to update the store for online commerce. We use authorize.net for credit card purchases, and that tool needs to be integrated into the new store. In addition, the functionality of the store needs to be improved, so that we can order the things for sale more easily. 

3. The portions of the site that the students last term did not get to have to be migrated: the Journal section (the archives need to be migrated with descriptions of the contents of the sixty issues published to date, with links to the Criticism section when these existed in the old site); the Finder's Guide, which contains upwards of 13000 items referring to more than three hundred thousand references in Borges's work needs to be migrated, including links to two important reference works, Evelyn Fishburn and Psiche Hughes's 1990 A Dictionary of Borges (updated by Fishburn on the Borges Center website) and Cristina Parodi's Borges-Bioy en contexto (published by the Borges Center as a book in 2018); the “Bibliographies” section should be renamed “Timeline Bibliography,” and the old references to outdated bibliographies by Annick Louis and Sergio Pastormerlo should be eliminated; in the “In the Arts” section dead links should be updated or eliminated; the functionality of the “News and Events” section should be updated to make it easier to edit and reorder.

4. To check for dead links throughout the website, and to update them when possible. The SCI students in fall 2025 identified dead links in the Borges Center timeline, most of them relating to YouTube videos, but the whole website needs to be searched for dead links.

5.	We used to have a Google Analytics tool to track usage around the world, but that tool stopped functioning in some prior update. A new analytics tool should be integrated, along with instructions for us on how to edit the site. 

6.	When the whole website is ready, to make it live.

We look forward to working with new students in spring 2026!

### An Intelligent Math Diagnostic & Intervention App for Teachers
**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to develop a mobile-first web or tablet application that transforms a large, paper-based interview guide for teachers into a streamlined, digital tool for educators. In particular, the app will guide teachers through 1-on-1 or small-group diagnostic interviews with students, automate the analysis of students' mathematical thinking, and provide immediate, research-backed intervention activities built into the materials to address specific gaps in understanding in real time.

**Background:**

The Institute for Learning (IFL) at the University of Pittsburgh is a leading provider of professional learning and resources for school districts across the U.S. Our flagship resource, SOAR, is designed to support teachers as they work with elementary students who demonstrate, through formative or diagnostic assessment, that they need additional high-level learning opportunities on a concept(s)/standard(s). SOAR uses a strengths-based, “asset model” rather than a deficit model, focusing on what students can do to build conceptual understanding. Teachers diagnose students on specific mathematics topics and mathematical practices through a written assessment that is accompanied by a set of interview questions. Student written and verbal responses are used to identify what students demonstrate and what they do not, and these results are used to determine particular SOAR activities. Currently, while teachers find the contents extremely useful, the system’s effectiveness is limited by its manual, paper-heavy format and multiple components. By digitizing SOAR as an app, we aim to provide a more user-friendly solution for teachers that can also provide additional improvements that can occur in an app.

**Project Goals:**
Priority Areas:
- Dynamic Interview Interface: Build a wizard-like interface that guides teachers through 1-on-1 student interviews and adapts questions based on student input.
- Automated Diagnostic Engine: Implement logic to cross-reference student responses with "Learning Maps" to identify specific knowledge assets and areas of need.
- Instant Intervention Generator: Develop a system that recommends specific SOAR activities and instructional moves immediately after a diagnostic session.
- Secure Data Management: Create a backend to store student profiles, historical interview data, and growth tracking for individual classrooms.

Possible Secondary Areas:
- Administrator Dashboard: A visualization tool for school leaders to see aggregated progress data across grade levels or schools.
- Natural Language Processing: Rather than giving teachers categorical response categories to check, input raw student talk and categorize automatically.
- Offline Capability: Ensuring the app can function in classrooms with inconsistent internet access and sync data when a connection is restored.
- Multimedia Integration: Capability to record student verbal reasoning or take photos of student work (scratchpad) during the interview.

Team Size: 3-4 students

### Algorithm Stories

**Overview:**
The project seeks to support the people of Allegheny County in understanding and intervening in public-sector algorithms (AI) used for decision-making by local government agencies. The current public-sector AI ecosystem has no standardized practices for procurement, deployment, and regulation of AI systems. There are also no possibilities of recourse available to the people if they are adversely impacted by these systems.

We seek to bring the community organizations and the public agencies together in managing the functioning and procurement of public-sector AI systems. The project will serve as a registry of public algorithms containing the details of specific use-cases, concerned government agencies, and a storyboard depicting its development and deployment process.
The platform will also allow users to submit their concerns and stories about the impacts caused by these systems. The public agencies can utilize these user stories to understand the impacts and address the relevant concerns in their systems. It can act as a feedback for public agencies to support the monitoring and regulation of AI systems while also informing their future procurements.

**Development**: A Web Application

We will develop an interactive web application that informs the public about existing public-sector algorithms and enables direct participation through feedback, discussion, and collaboration. The main features of the web application are:
- Algorithm Information Hub (Interactive Learning):
  - Users can explore algorithm pages with visual explanations, impact maps, and examples.
  - Comment sections or discussion threads allow public questions and insights.
- User Submission and Story Sharing:
  - Individuals can share personal experiences about being affected by specific algorithms.
  - Others can react, comment, or support (“I’ve experienced this too”) to build collective awareness.
- Clustering and Insights (Interactive Data Exploration):
  - Users and reviewers can explore visual clusters of submissions by topic.
- Reviewer and Community Interaction:
  - Reviewers (community organizations) can respond to user stories, verify them, and provide feedback directly.
  - Public users can see when their stories are being reviewed or forwarded.
- Issue Forwarding and Tracking:
  - Reviewed issues can be sent to relevant agencies. An interactive dashboard lets users follow the status of their submissions (“Under Review,” “Forwarded,” “Resolved”).
**TECH STACK**: Basic HTML/CSS/JS; React

Team Size: 3-5 students

### Multi-Objective RL Environment Creation

We are developing a new deep multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm. Currently, we are in the early stages of implementation, with plans to apply it to the Traffic Signal Control domain once the initial implementation and validation are complete. We are looking for students to propose and explore a second, research-relevant domain where they can set up experiments and benchmarks. We are flexible with tasks and domains, as we want students to work on something they are passionate about.

This is a research-focused, hands-on project. We are seeking one (potentially two) teams of 2–3 self-motivated, curious students with a solid foundation in Python (experience in reinforcement learning is a plus). Students will engage in tasks such as reading papers, setting up experiments, and reproducing benchmarks. If time permits, they may also help by performing experimentation with our method.

Some example simulation environments to inspire proposals:
- RWARE: Robot warehouse coordination
- OpenDC: Data center task scheduling
- Grid2Op: Critical power grid control
- Flatland: Railway traffic routing
- Other RL Environments: Any well-documented RL environment suitable for defining a multi-objective task

Team Size: 2-3 students

### AI Racing RC Car
I have two remote controllable RC cars with cameras and Nvidia Jetson GPUs. I would like to develop a system for them that can be used to teach the cars to drive around various areas and race each other. The software for these systems needs work is simple and I would like to build out tooling that will allow for it to easily record user controlled demonstrations, run the cars autonomously, and be able to give feedback to the car on how well it is doing. I also need functionality developed to do some learning from demonstration to create a model that can be used to drive the car autonomously. There is lots of room for innovation in this project and to do both AI work and software engineering. If you are interested in AI, autonomous systems, or edge devices this could be a great project for you.
