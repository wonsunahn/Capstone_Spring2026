# Capstone Project List
Below is a list of the projects for the Spring 2026 semester. 

# Community Projects
## Pitt Street Medicine Team
### Pitt Street Medicine Street Go

**Objective**: The objective of this capstone project is to continue developing Street Med Go, a multimodal accessible website application for individuals served by Street Medicine at Pitt, including those at the Second Avenue Commons Clinic. 

The project's focus is to allow individuals to request/order necessities, including food, beverages, clothing, toiletries, basic medical supplies, and other supplies as needed, in addition to Street Medicine at Pitt’s weekly Wednesday evening “street rounds,” and make modifications as appropriate based on client feedback.

**Background**: Street Medicine at Pitt is a student-run interdisciplinary organization dedicated to providing healthcare and social support to the rough-sleeping and unhoused communities in Pittsburgh. The organization is affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, which recently established the Center for Street Medicine. Street Medicine at Pitt partners with the Second Avenue Commons Clinic, which provides shelter access, medical services, and engagement centers for adults experiencing homelessness in Pittsburgh.

## Borges Center
### Borges Site Migration and Enhancement

Jorge Luis Borges (Buenos Aires, Argentina 1899-Geneva, Switzerland1986) was the most important writer in Spanish in the twentieth century, considered one of the great world writers of the modern period. In 1995 Iván Almeida and Cristina Parodi founded the Borges Center at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. When they retired from Aarhus, they ceded the direction of the Center to Daniel Balderston, and it has been housed at the University of Iowa (2006-2008) and then at the University of Pittsburgh (2008-present). The Center is currently co-directed by Balderston and Alfredo Alonso Estenoz (Luther College). The website is consulted by students and scholars all over the world. It includes a detailed timeline of Borges's life and works, links to countless first versions of his work, a vast collection of criticism, a Finder's Guide or index to his writing, abundant information about his talks and interviews, and works of music and the visual arts that were inspired by him. The current website is www.borges.pitt.edu and is a Drupal site housed at the University of Pittsburgh. The recent decision by the university to move websites from Drupal to Open Scholar means that the site needs to be updated.

In fall 2025 two excellent SCI students, Jing Tong and Hiuyeung Kong, worked on revising the site so that it can be hosted on Open Scholar. They were able to move much of the site to a development page, (https://researchsites.pitt.edu/borgescenter)[https://researchsites.pitt.edu/borgescenter]. To finish the job we need two SCI students in spring 2026. The main tasks will be:

1. To try to match the appearance of the old side as closely as possible. The Open Scholar version uses sans serif fonts on the home page, but these should be serif fonts, and the font sizes and appearance should be unified within the whole site.

2. The students last semester did not have time to update the store for online commerce. We use authorize.net for credit card purchases, and that tool needs to be integrated into the new store. In addition, the functionality of the store needs to be improved, so that we can order the things for sale more easily. 

3. The portions of the site that the students last term did not get to have to be migrated: the Journal section (the archives need to be migrated with descriptions of the contents of the sixty issues published to date, with links to the Criticism section when these existed in the old site); the Finder's Guide, which contains upwards of 13000 items referring to more than three hundred thousand references in Borges's work needs to be migrated, including links to two important reference works, Evelyn Fishburn and Psiche Hughes's 1990 A Dictionary of Borges (updated by Fishburn on the Borges Center website) and Cristina Parodi's Borges-Bioy en contexto (published by the Borges Center as a book in 2018); the “Bibliographies” section should be renamed “Timeline Bibliography,” and the old references to outdated bibliographies by Annick Louis and Sergio Pastormerlo should be eliminated; in the “In the Arts” section dead links should be updated or eliminated; the functionality of the “News and Events” section should be updated to make it easier to edit and reorder.

4. To check for dead links throughout the website, and to update them when possible. The SCI students in fall 2025 identified dead links in the Borges Center timeline, most of them relating to YouTube videos, but the whole website needs to be searched for dead links.

5.	We used to have a Google Analytics tool to track usage around the world, but that tool stopped functioning in some prior update. A new analytics tool should be integrated, along with instructions for us on how to edit the site. 

6.	When the whole website is ready, to make it live.

We look forward to working with new students in spring 2026!

## Lymphoma Coalition
Website: (https://lymphomacoalition.org/)[https://lymphomacoalition.org/]

### Lymphoma Colition Organization RElationship System (LCORS)

Description:
Over the years, the LC has grown in size to include over 90 lymphoma cancer patient organizations in over 55 countries.  With that growth, it has become difficult to manage their contact information for each organization, and to track contacts(touches), relationships and activities that the LC does on their behalf, and that partner organizations do on behalf of the LC.  

A database/CRM system was developed several years ago (using Access on a server), but it got corrupted during the COVID pandemic years, and is no longer usable.  The LC does have the original specifications, and maps of relationships to help in building out a new solution.  They are not necessarily focused on using any one software tool. However, the solution has to be simple enough that it would be relatively easy to maintain and update in the future, yet robust enough to satisfy their requirements.  The database would be placed on a server, and staff would have access to it.

The LC is looking for recommendations and implementation by the end of the Spring Term.

Team Size: 2-4 students

## Neuraville
### Perception AI Model Development

This capstone will focus on the design, implementation, and evaluation of perception AI models applicable across robotics and non-robotics domains. Student teams will work on problems such as object recognition and counting, anomaly detection, motion sensing, localization, and pose estimation using real-world and synthetic datasets. Reasonable expectations include developing working models, establishing training and evaluation pipelines, documenting performance tradeoffs, and delivering reproducible results that can be integrated into downstream systems or demonstrated through benchmarks and demos.

Team Size: 2-12 students (broken into sub-teams)

POC: Mohammad Nadji (nadji@neuraville.com)

### Open-Source Community Development

This capstone centers on building and strengthening an open-source ecosystem around our advanced AI/robotics platform FEAGI. Students will take on a technical marketing engineer–style role, contributing through documentation improvements, tutorials, sample projects, developer guides, and technical content such as blogs or walkthroughs. Expectations include improving contributor onboarding, clarifying APIs and workflows, producing measurable improvements in usability and engagement, and leaving behind maintainable assets that lower the barrier for new developers and researchers to adopt the platform.

Team Size: 2-6 students

POC: Mohammad Nadji (nadji@neuraville.com)

### FEAGI Java SDK Development
Students will develop a core Java SDK for FEAGI that covers the essential functionality needed to connect to FEAGI services, stimulate neurons, and receive sensorimotor feedback. Deliverables include working core APIs, a few representative example applications, and concise, practical documentation sufficient for other developers to get started. The focus is on creating a stable, usable foundation rather than a full feature-parity SDK with exhaustive coverage. 

Team Size: 2-3 students

## Chris Schunn
### An Intelligent Math Diagnostic & Intervention App for Teachers
**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to develop a mobile-first web or tablet application that transforms a large, paper-based interview guide for teachers into a streamlined, digital tool for educators. In particular, the app will guide teachers through 1-on-1 or small-group diagnostic interviews with students, automate the analysis of students' mathematical thinking, and provide immediate, research-backed intervention activities built into the materials to address specific gaps in understanding in real time.

**Background:**

The Institute for Learning (IFL) at the University of Pittsburgh is a leading provider of professional learning and resources for school districts across the U.S. Our flagship resource, SOAR, is designed to support teachers as they work with elementary students who demonstrate, through formative or diagnostic assessment, that they need additional high-level learning opportunities on a concept(s)/standard(s). SOAR uses a strengths-based, “asset model” rather than a deficit model, focusing on what students can do to build conceptual understanding. Teachers diagnose students on specific mathematics topics and mathematical practices through a written assessment that is accompanied by a set of interview questions. Student written and verbal responses are used to identify what students demonstrate and what they do not, and these results are used to determine particular SOAR activities. Currently, while teachers find the contents extremely useful, the system’s effectiveness is limited by its manual, paper-heavy format and multiple components. By digitizing SOAR as an app, we aim to provide a more user-friendly solution for teachers that can also provide additional improvements that can occur in an app.

**Project Goals:**
Priority Areas:
- Dynamic Interview Interface: Build a wizard-like interface that guides teachers through 1-on-1 student interviews and adapts questions based on student input.
- Automated Diagnostic Engine: Implement logic to cross-reference student responses with "Learning Maps" to identify specific knowledge assets and areas of need.
- Instant Intervention Generator: Develop a system that recommends specific SOAR activities and instructional moves immediately after a diagnostic session.
- Secure Data Management: Create a backend to store student profiles, historical interview data, and growth tracking for individual classrooms.

Possible Secondary Areas:
- Administrator Dashboard: A visualization tool for school leaders to see aggregated progress data across grade levels or schools.
- Natural Language Processing: Rather than giving teachers categorical response categories to check, input raw student talk and categorize automatically.
- Offline Capability: Ensuring the app can function in classrooms with inconsistent internet access and sync data when a connection is restored.
- Multimedia Integration: Capability to record student verbal reasoning or take photos of student work (scratchpad) during the interview.

Team Size: 3-4 students

### Algorithm Stories

**Overview:**
The project seeks to support the people of Allegheny County in understanding and intervening in public-sector algorithms (AI) used for decision-making by local government agencies. The current public-sector AI ecosystem has no standardized practices for procurement, deployment, and regulation of AI systems. There are also no possibilities of recourse available to the people if they are adversely impacted by these systems.

We seek to bring the community organizations and the public agencies together in managing the functioning and procurement of public-sector AI systems. The project will serve as a registry of public algorithms containing the details of specific use-cases, concerned government agencies, and a storyboard depicting its development and deployment process.
The platform will also allow users to submit their concerns and stories about the impacts caused by these systems. The public agencies can utilize these user stories to understand the impacts and address the relevant concerns in their systems. It can act as a feedback for public agencies to support the monitoring and regulation of AI systems while also informing their future procurements.

**Development**: A Web Application

We will develop an interactive web application that informs the public about existing public-sector algorithms and enables direct participation through feedback, discussion, and collaboration. The main features of the web application are:
- Algorithm Information Hub (Interactive Learning):
  - Users can explore algorithm pages with visual explanations, impact maps, and examples.
  - Comment sections or discussion threads allow public questions and insights.
- User Submission and Story Sharing:
  - Individuals can share personal experiences about being affected by specific algorithms.
  - Others can react, comment, or support (“I’ve experienced this too”) to build collective awareness.
- Clustering and Insights (Interactive Data Exploration):
  - Users and reviewers can explore visual clusters of submissions by topic.
- Reviewer and Community Interaction:
  - Reviewers (community organizations) can respond to user stories, verify them, and provide feedback directly.
  - Public users can see when their stories are being reviewed or forwarded.
- Issue Forwarding and Tracking:
  - Reviewed issues can be sent to relevant agencies. An interactive dashboard lets users follow the status of their submissions (“Under Review,” “Forwarded,” “Resolved”).
**TECH STACK**: Basic HTML/CSS/JS; React

### Logic App

Using Svelte to build an interactive application like logisim.
This work started last Spring and later developed last Fall, but the tool is missing some functionality. Mainly: Wires! I want to be able to place wires where I want to! And right now they are drawn automatically.

The first couple of weeks are expected to be dedicated to your understanding and re-deployment of
existing code. During that period, you will (with my help) plan the changes and development for the rest
of the semester. The initial goals will be to redesign the wires system to allow me to draw wires like in
Logisim. Then, we'll focus on trying to recreate CS0447 circuits to identify the missing functionality
and components. E.g.: counters, flip-flops, etc.

Languages: Javascript/Svelte.


Team size: 3-4 students

### RAWRS

For DECADES CS 0447 was taught using MIPS assembly language. However, MIPS processors are not that common anymore (RIP PS and PS2) (they still live in network equipment though, but barely
:). On the other hand, the RISC-V architecture (open-source) is gaining some momentum, and you can even buy some boards to have fun with it.
We are still using MARS (which we all hate ;), but we want to push the development of an alternative that uses RISC-V. wilkie developed a web-based alternative, a few semesters of capstones worked on it, but it's still not ready for primetime: https://https://gitlab.com/luisfnqoliveira/RAWRS

This tool is called RAWRS (RISC-V Assembler and Workable, Rewritable System) - it's an acronym it can mean whatever we want! - and it's a web-based tools (bye bye Java).
The objective for this project is to develop this tool further to a point where it can be used for CS 447.
      - Test and fix the previous code that warns about convention violations
      - Test and fix the previous code that enabled Memory-Mapped devices implemented in Javascript
      - Adapt the website (Javascript development) to new functionality (implement plugins).
The tool is written in (modern) Javascript where we predict most of the development will be focused. But you will also have the opportunity to stretch your assembly muscles. As the RISC-V simulator is backed by a RISC-V kernel :D

Languages: Javascript/C.

### Class scheduling app


Scheduling is hard! Understatement of the century.

Since I've started assigning TAs to classes, I've seen schedulers make a lot of mistakes.
Since I've started assigning TAs to classes, I've realised why! Cause I also make them :)
This project aims at finding them in an automated manner.


There is software in place to schedule and
manage classes. What I want is not to rebuild that software. Instead, I want to export a schedule from there, and parse it to detect potential issues. Which issues? That's part of it. I don't know, so I want anyone to be able to add rules easily down the road. The way I envisioned the program is like a sort of testing framework where someone who doesn't program will be able to write tests.


**What will you be doing?**
      - You will talk to people doing the schedule and discuss with them what they think they need, and translate that as a program.
**What do we know now?**
      - Your program will take some sort of CSV/JSON file as input, and then parse classes and recitations for a set of rules that should output *Good*, *Warning*, or *Bad*.
      - Your program will have a basic test definition language that you'll need to translate to your testing framework so the tests can be expanded in the future.
      - Rules could be in the form of: two recitations for the same class should not happen at the same time; two recitations for the same section should not happen in different buildings within 10 minutes.
      - Languages: Whatever you find appropriate.

### Domain gaps in action recognition for older adults 

**Description**: 

As AI gains better understanding of visual data capturing human activity, applications to understand human challenges and enhance quality of life become more abundant, as so does data that can be used for pilot studies. One such dataset is Ego4D (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07058) which captures very diverse participants performing diverse everyday and professional activities (cooking, gardening, construction). However, it is not clear how well models trained on this data would perform on data from specific populations, such as older adults. The goal of this project is to examine what distinguishes data provided by older (say 70+) vs younger participants, identify domain gaps in performance on certain classification tasks (e.g. action recognition, and whether performing these tasks on older people data is harder), and how performance gaps can be bridged-- perhaps using intermediate representations, e.g. pose, where poses recognition itself can be tailored towards specific populations more easily because they are simpler and more short-term, while compositions of poses (steps of computing an activity) perhaps generalize across populations.

Team Size: 2-3 students

### Temporal trends in satellite data

**Description**: 

Satellite data contains interesting information with impact for urban planning, disaster response, and even traffic law adherence. Some of this information is temporal (patterns that change over time). Some prior work on temporal trends is explored in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08727) but using street view data. What trends about important phenomena (poverty, environmental changes, disasters, policy violations) can be inferred by comparing different timestamps in satellite datasets? Some datasets of potential interest include: USGS EarthExplorer, Google Earth Engine, Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, PlanetScope and SkySat, Global Enhanced Geoint Delivery, Google Earth Engine, DeepGlobe, xView, but feasibility of use of these datasets requires investigation. Another interesting task on this data is to examine temporal domain generalization in satellite data-- what reasons are there why a model trained on data from time period X, may not do well on data from time period Y, for a particular task (e.g. building segmentation).

### Out-of-the-box persuasive media
**Description**: 

GenAI models have the potential to democratize creation of media, including advertisements, with low effort. However AI model creativity is still not well understood. The goal of this project is to examine how GenAI models can create persuasive advertisements out of completely random combinations (not frequently co-occurring) objects, in similar spirit to this (paper)[https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Guo_Detecting_Persuasive_Atypicality_by_Modeling_Contextual_Compatibility_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf and https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2025/papers/Aghazadeh_CAP_Evaluation_of_Persuasive_and_Creative_Image_Generation_ICCV_2025_paper.pdf]. The challenge is for AI models to score which random combinations make sense, even if infrequent, and which don't.

### Multi-Objective RL Environment Creation

We are developing a new deep multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm. Currently, we are in the early stages of implementation, with plans to apply it to the Traffic Signal Control domain once the initial implementation and validation are complete. We are looking for students to propose and explore a second, research-relevant domain where they can set up experiments and benchmarks. We are flexible with tasks and domains, as we want students to work on something they are passionate about.

This is a research-focused, hands-on project. We are seeking one (potentially two) teams of 2–3 self-motivated, curious students with a solid foundation in Python (experience in reinforcement learning is a plus). Students will engage in tasks such as reading papers, setting up experiments, and reproducing benchmarks. If time permits, they may also help by performing experimentation with our method.

Some example simulation environments to inspire proposals:
- RWARE: Robot warehouse coordination
- OpenDC: Data center task scheduling
- Grid2Op: Critical power grid control
- Flatland: Railway traffic routing
- Other RL Environments: Any well-documented RL environment suitable for defining a multi-objective task

### AI Racing RC Car
I have two remote controllable RC cars with cameras and Nvidia Jetson GPUs. I would like to develop a system for them that can be used to teach the cars to drive around various areas and race each other. The software for these systems needs work is simple and I would like to build out tooling that will allow for it to easily record user controlled demonstrations, run the cars autonomously, and be able to give feedback to the car on how well it is doing. I also need functionality developed to do some learning from demonstration to create a model that can be used to drive the car autonomously. There is lots of room for innovation in this project and to do both AI work and software engineering. If you are interested in AI, autonomous systems, or edge devices this could be a great project for you.

### Garden Produce Website
I have a small garden and nursery where I sell produce and plants. I would like to build a website that allows me to list my products, take orders, and manage inventory. The website should have a simple and clean design, be easy to navigate, and be mobile-friendly. I would also like to have a backend system that allows me to easily update the product listings, manage orders, and track inventory. This project would be a great opportunity for students interested in web development and e-commerce. Other than I want it to require minimal and easily updated, there is a lot of room for creativity in the design and functionality of the website.
