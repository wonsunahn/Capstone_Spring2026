## Presentation Score Leader Board

This table will be populated with (anonymous) peer review scores for each
presentation, on each week when there is a presentation.  The top scorer
will receive the [Best Capstone Speaker Award](#peer-review-organization).

|Name|Content Score|Organization Score|Delivery Score|Overall Score|
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| Average | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

## Your responsibilities

You must fulfill all of these responsibilities to get a satisfactory grade:

1. Attend each class synchronously.  See [Attendance](#attendance).

1. Give a presentation on your work.  See [Presentation organization](#presentation-organization).

1. Write a final paper.  See [Final paper organization](#final-paper-organization).

1. Fill out peer reviews for each presentation on TopHat.  See [Peer review organization](#peer-review-organization)

1. (CS 1950 students only) send regular progress reports.  See [Progress report organization](#progress-report-organization).

Failure to fulfill any of the above responsibilities may result in a "Not
Complete" grade or a penalty on your letter grade.

## Attendance

* TopHat attendance will be taken for each class.

* Attendance must occur in-person.  If you have extenuating circumstance
  (such as a medical or family emergency), please let me know immediately
and I will allow remote particiation or other means of participation.

* **NOTE:** You may miss **2 classes** in the entire semester without an
  extenuating circumstance.  3 or more missed classes will result in a
failure.


## Presentation organization

* The presentation schedule will be finalized using a poll.  This is the official schedule as it stands now:
  * [Presentation Schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/internship_presentation_schedule)

* It looks like we are going to have one presentation per day.  Please time
  your presentation time to be ~30 minutes so that we can have ~20 minutes of
Q&A.

* Please review the [Lecture on Presentations]({{site.baseurl}}/internships/pdfs/lecture-on-presentations-internship.pdf) and the [Lecture on
  Assertion Evidence Format]({{site.baseurl}}/internships/pdfs/lecture-on-assertion-evidence-format.pdf) before giving your presentation.  

* Presenters must submit their presentation slides to the "Presentation Slides"
  assignment on Canvas the day before, by **Thursday 9:00 PM**.  The slides
will be uploaded to TopHat for the presentation next day.  The preferred format
is PDF or Powerpoint.  Please note that simple Powerpoint animations like
appearing and disappearing work on TopHat, but if you use more fancy animations
they might not, so please let me know by email and I will give you further
instructions.

* Recordings of presenters are uploaded to Canvas Panopto within an hour of the
  talk.  Watching a recording of your own talk can be an enlightening
experience (you can trust me on this).

* **NOTE:** If your presentation is not satisfactory, you will be asked to
  present once more with your instructor one-on-one outside of class hours.
This will be your last chance to give a satisfactory presentation.

## Final paper organization

* Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience.  For details, see the
[Final Paper Instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/final_paper).  PDF format is
preferred.  The paper is to be submitted to Canvas by **Friday midnight 
of the week following your presentation**.

## Peer review organization

* For each presenter, there will be a folder in TopHat containing the slides
  for the presentation and a few peer review questions.  The TopHat questions
should be submitted to TopHat by **Friday midnight on the day of the
presentation**.

* Please do not peer review yourself (obviously).

* Please review [tips for writing a good review]({{site.baseurl}}/review_tips).
  Be specific about what you liked and disliked.

* Peer review scores are anonymized when posted to TopHat --- only score
  averages will be made available to the presenter.  Also the peer reviews
**will not impact the presenter's grade**.  That means you can give honest
feedback and scores without feeling guilty about lowering your friend's
grade.  The purpose is to give constructive feedback so that your friend can
improve.  

* Your scores will also be used to decide the Best Capstone Speaker award,
which is given to three students with the highest overall scores (the sum of
the Content, Organization, and Delivery scores).  Cash prizes of $100, $50,
and $20 will be given to the PittFund$Me accounts of meriting students, as
well as certificates.

## Progress report organization

This section is only for CS 1950 students.

* Please submit progress reports to the Canvas SCI Experiential Learning Hub on
  the dates specified (it is on a bi-weekly cadence).  The report allows your
research advisor to monitor your progress and spot communication problems
before they become a major issue.

* The progress reports are meant to help you, not burden you.  The main
  consumer of the report is your research advisor, so you can use whatever
format conveys the information best to your advisor.  Some professors prefer
bullet points over flowing text.

* Your advisor will "Approve" your report if your progress is satisfactory ---
  otherwise feedback will be given.
